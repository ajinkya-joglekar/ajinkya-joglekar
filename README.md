# 🌟 Welcome to My GitHub Repository! 🌟

Hi there! I'm **Ajinkya Joglekar**, a passionate Ph.D. candidate at the prestigious **Clemson University's International Center for Automotive Research (ICAR)**, nestled in the vibrant city of Greenville, SC. 🚗🔧 I'm thrilled to share my journey and research in the cutting-edge realm of on-road and off-road Uncrewed Ground Vehicle systems (UGVs). 

## 🚀 About My Research:
My research focuses on developing scalable and adaptive frameworks for **data-driven modeling, motion planning,** and **control of UGVs**. I'm on a mission to transform theoretical frameworks into practical ecosystems, addressing the challenges modern UGVs face in dangerous, uncertain terrains.

🔍 **Key Highlights:**
- **Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Controllers**: Adaptive data-driven implicit modeling for UGVs.
- **Koopman Operator Theory**: Expanding the horizons of explainable data-driven modeling with analytical formulation of Koopman Operators for UGV.
- **Project ***** (Coming Soon 😉)**: An innovative ecosystem for creating universal models from teleoperated data in challenging terrains, featuring a state-of-the-art kinodynamic planner and a robust path-tracking controller based on Multi-Model Parameterized Koopman framework!

By blending these methodologies, I aim to enhance the intelligence and decision-making capabilities of autonomous vehicles, pushing their operational envelope even further in diverse and challenging conditions.

## 🌱 My Interests:
I'm captivated by the potential of **autonomous robots and vehicles** to address real-world challenges. My goal is to develop solutions that positively impact our environment and lifestyle, making a difference one line of code at a time.

## 🤝 Collaboration and Contributions:
I firmly believe in the power of **teamwork**. I'm always open to collaborating with like-minded individuals and teams to tackle autonomy's most challenging problems. Together, we can pool our expertise and create groundbreaking solutions that shape the future of autonomous systems.
